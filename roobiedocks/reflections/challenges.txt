Challenges:

1. Completing the course. More specifically, not dropping out once the going gets tough. 
2. Career change and the fear and doubt that accompanies that move. 
3. Having ‘learned’ programming languages before, I’m worried that I’ll get through the nano degree and then not know what in the hell I’m doing.
